Description: fbxapitool
        ==========
        
	Warning : this package deals with documented API functions, where some are unstables meaning these can change in the future ; moreover some others are not documented (OpenVPN Client & VM management), then they are more unstables
	
	This package is an evolution of "freepybox", available here : https://github.com/fstercq/freepybox. In addition of many modifications, it brings new functions to missing API calls. But the Freebox API is not fully covered. Some features has not been tested, as they refers to options that I've not subscribed. It was developed with Python 3 with Delta S box, and tested under Linux (Debian & Ubuntu) and macOS. I've no idea of the effort required to used it on Windows 10, and I'll not do it. Last but not least, it'll only work with last version of the API in end of 2020, which mean version 8.
